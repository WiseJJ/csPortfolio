*this is my hardest code... its the code to create lightning, and it took awhile for me to learn how to use random to properly make and manipulate the lightning too fit my project 
```Java
 public void lightning1(){
    stroke(255,255,0);
  while(endX<=900){
  endX = startX + (int)(Math.random()*9);
  endY = startY + (int)((Math.random()*60)-30);
  line(startX, startY, endX, endY);
  startX= endX;
  startY = endY;
  }
```
